# Benchmarking parameters
# This changes how many times the benchmark is run,
# and what the statistics are like.
benchmarking_parameters:
  # Number of rounds to run the benchmark
  test_rounds: 5
  # Number of iterations per round
  test_iter: 1
  # Number of warmup rounds
  test_warmup_rounds: 2

# Global parameters
# These parameters DO change the size of the system.
# The chain size is the number of qubits in the chain
# matrices will be of the size 2**(2*chain_size)
global_parameters:
  # this scales the size of the chain.
  global_chain_size: 6
  # This changes the duration of the pulse. Does not affect the size of the system.
  # However, longer gate times will require more intervals to converge accurately.
  # You may not need to change this parameter.
  global_test_gate_time: 20
  # This changes the number of points in the time list.
  # This will also affect the accuracy of the Magnus expansion.
  # Directly affects the size of the time array in memory.
  # This array will typically not be large enough to fill GPU memory.
  # This needs to always be greater than the number of magnus intervals, 
  # and the number of points in the time list should be a multiple of the number of magnus intervals.
  # Change this parameter to increase the number of Magnus intervals used in the benchmark.
  global_test_num_tlist: 10000
  # This is a list of number of Magnus intervals to see scaling. 
  # This should be less than global_test_num_tlist.
  # This will affect the size of the full Magnus array in memory.
  # Size is expected to be 2**(2*chain_size)*num_intervals which will be passed to expm.
  # This parameter and the one above are the most important for scaling.
