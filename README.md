${\rm qCH_{eff}}$ (/kju ʃɛf/) calculates effective Hamiltonians for quantum systems.


# Getting Started
 ${\rm qCH_{eff}}$ can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qcheff/) using `pip`:
```sh
pip install qcheff
 ```

Detailed installation instruction are [provided here](https://qcheff.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/install.html). CuPy is required in order to use the GPU for computations.
